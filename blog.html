                <p>Tiny hands dive into mounds of soft clay. <br/>
                Each squish, squeeze, and roll sparks a new world of wonder.</p>

                <p>Shapes slowly emerge-sometimes planned, sometimes accidental, but always meaningful. In the midst of giggles
                and deep concentration, children mould not just clay, but their imagination into reality. What begins as a
                formless lump soon becomes an animal, a house, or a dream yet unnamed.</p>

                <p>I watched a group of children busily working with vibrant clay, their laughter filling the air. Some shaped simple
                animals, others built imaginative castles. One child, completely absorbed, carefully moulded a small clay cat.
                When he finished, his face lit up with pride and joy.</p>

                 <p>That moment took me back to my own childhood in the village, where I spent hours playing with clay, free from
                screens and guided only by my imagination. Those simple experiences shaped how I think, create, and design
                today.</p>

                 <p>Watching these children, I was reminded of how essential tactile play is for growth. These moments with clay
                aren’t just playtime; they are the foundation of creativity, problem-solving, and emotional expression.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes, the simplest materials create the strongest memories.</p>

                <p>As a toy designer, I deeply believe that play in the first 0–3 years lays the foundation for lifelong growth.
                  <br/><br/>
                  From sensory rattles and textured toys to building blocks and pretend play sets, each stage supports vital motor, cognitive, and emotional development.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Every interaction helps nurture curiosity, coordination, creativity, and imagination.
                  <br/><br/>
                  Thoughtfully designed toys are more than just fun, they shape early learning experiences.
                  <br/><br/>
                  For me, designing toys means designing purposeful play that supports a child’s journey of discovery.

                <p>Between ages 4 -10, play evolves from imagination to structured thinking and deeper problem-solving.
                  <br/><br/>
                  The right toys at each stage nurture creativity, confidence, logic, and curiosity.
                  <br/><br/>
                  From pretend play and simple games to STEM kits and robotics, every tool shapes how children explore and understand the world.
                  <br/>
                  As designers, we’re not just making toys - we’re building foundations for innovation and independent thinking.
                  <br/><br/>
                 Thoughtful play today creates the creators of tomorrow.

                <p>Between ages 10–20, play transforms from simple fun into a powerful tool for growth, identity, and future readiness.

                  <br/><br/>
                  From exploration and skill-building to strategy, collaboration, and innovation, toys become platforms for thinking and creating.

                  <br/><br/>
                  This stage bridges imagination with real-world application, shaping logic, confidence, and leadership.

                  <br/><br/>
                  As a toy designer, I see this phase as where play meets purpose — building the innovators of tomorrow.
